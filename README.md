Azure Sentinel (SIEM) Tutorial - October 2023

 ### [Inspired by this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoZeVbbZ0o0)
 Title:  SIEM Tutorial for Beginners | Azure Sentinel Tutorial MAP with LIVE CYBER ATTACKS!<br/>
 Creator: Josh Madakor<br/>
 Date of video: November 1, 2021
 

<h2>Description</h2>

"In this video, I setup Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and connect it to a live virtual machine acting as a honey pot. We will observe live attacks (RDP Brute Force) from all around the world. We will use a custom PowerShell script to look up the attackers Geolocation information and plot it on the Azure Sentinel Map! LEARN THIS IN DEPTH AND PUT THIS ON YOUR RESUME!" --Josh Madakor<br/>
(copied from original YouTube video decription)

Microsoft Azure services have changed since the video's creation on Nov. 2021. After a lot of RTFM and a few Stack Overflow searches, I was able to complete the tutorial and get the desired results.
